 The user wants to login to the MinIO console. Based on the .env.example file I read earlier, the
  default MinIO credentials are:
  - Username: minioadmin
  - Password: minioadmin

● MinIO Console credentials:

  - Username: minioadmin
  - Password: minioadmin

  These are the default credentials from your .env file (S3_ACCESS_KEY and S3_SECRET_KEY).
