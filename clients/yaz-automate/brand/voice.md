### Sample 1: Why People Buy

> Unlike no-code platforms that require you to figure everything out yourself, or expensive development teams that speak in tech jargon, we handle everything from strategy to implementation — explaining it all in plain English so you actually understand what your AI is doing.

**Why it works:** Addresses the audience directly, positions against alternatives, emphasizes the "no jargon" promise.
