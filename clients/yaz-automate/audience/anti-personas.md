# Anti-Personas

> Who NOT to target — the customers that won't be successful or will drain resources.

## Anti-Persona #1: The Freebie Seeker

### Who They Are

**Description:**
> Looking for free solutions or expecting enterprise results on a shoestring budget. Often comparison shopping on price alone.

**Common titles:** Various

**Company characteristics:** Early-stage, bootstrapped with no budget, or just cheap

### Why They're a Bad Fit

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| No budget for quality implementation | Can't deliver results without proper investment |
| Expectations misaligned with reality | Constant scope creep, dissatisfaction |
| Time-consuming sales process | Low conversion, wasted effort |

### Red Flags in Sales Conversations

- [ ] "What's the cheapest option?"
- [ ] "Can you do this for equity/exposure?"
- [ ] "Our budget is [far below reasonable]"
- [ ] Comparing primarily to free tools
- [ ] Asking for discounts before understanding value

### What They Usually Ask For

- Free consultations with no intent to buy
- Unlimited revisions
- "Just a quick thing" that becomes a big project

### What Happens If We Take Them On

> Constant haggling, scope creep, slow payments, and ultimately unhappy even if we deliver well. Not worth the reputation risk or time investment.

## Anti-Persona #2: The Enterprise Buyer

### Who They Are

**Description:**
> Large companies with complex requirements, lengthy procurement processes, and needs beyond our current capabilities.

**Common titles:** Various enterprise roles

**Company characteristics:** 500+ employees, enterprise IT requirements

### Why They're a Bad Fit

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Need enterprise-grade security/compliance (SOC2, etc.) | We can't provide this yet |
| Lengthy procurement processes | Sales cycle too long for our stage |
| Complex integration requirements | Beyond current scope |

### Red Flags in Sales Conversations

- [ ] "Do you have SOC2 certification?"
- [ ] "We need to involve our IT security team"
- [ ] "Our procurement process takes 6-12 months"
- [ ] "We need SLA guarantees"
- [ ] "We have 500+ users who would need access"

### What They Usually Ask For

- SSO integration
- Detailed security questionnaires
- Custom SLAs
- Dedicated account management
- On-premise deployment options

### What Happens If We Take Them On

> We either can't close the deal (wasted time) or we close it and can't meet their requirements (reputation damage).

## Anti-Persona #3: The DIY Enthusiast

### Who They Are

**Description:**
> Someone who wants to learn to do it themselves, not pay for a done-for-you solution. They want consulting/teaching, not implementation.

**Common titles:** Various tech-curious roles

**Company characteristics:** Any size

### Why They're a Bad Fit

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Want education, not services | Misaligned expectations |
| Won't pay for done-for-you | Low revenue potential |
| Will try to replicate our work themselves | Time sink |

### Red Flags in Sales Conversations

- [ ] "Can you show me how to do this myself?"
- [ ] "I just need someone to get me started"
- [ ] "I've been watching YouTube tutorials on this"
- [ ] "I want to understand every technical detail"
- [ ] Heavy focus on tools/platforms rather than outcomes

### What They Usually Ask For

- Training sessions
- Documentation of how things work
- Source code or templates
- "Teach me to fish" approach

### What Happens If We Take Them On

> They don't value the done-for-you aspect, constantly question decisions, and may try to take our work in-house immediately.

## Notes

- Anti-personas will evolve as we learn from real client interactions
- Better to decline early than waste time or damage reputation
