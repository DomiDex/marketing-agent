# Differentiators

> What makes Yaz Automate different from alternatives.

---

## Core Differentiator

> We combine the customization of an agency with the simplicity of a done-for-you service — you get AI solutions built specifically for your business, explained in plain English, with ongoing support. No technical expertise required on your end.

**Why it matters:** SMB owners want AI benefits without the learning curve or tech headaches

**Proof:** [Building case studies — early stage]

## Key Differentiators

### Differentiator 1: Done-For-You, Not DIY

**What it is:** We handle everything — strategy, implementation, and ongoing support

**Why it matters:** Owners don't have time to learn new tools or become automation experts

**Competitors lack this because:**
- Zapier/Make require you to figure it out yourself
- Freelancers often hand off without training or support
- Enterprise agencies are too expensive and complex

**Proof points:**
- Full-service from assessment to launch
- Ongoing support included

**How to talk about it:**
> "Unlike tools that expect you to figure it out yourself, we handle everything — so you can focus on your business."

### Differentiator 2: Plain English, No Jargon

**What it is:** We explain what your AI does so you actually understand it

**Why it matters:** Many owners have been burned by tech vendors who talked over their heads

**Competitors lack this because:**
- Developers speak in technical terms
- Many agencies assume technical knowledge
- Tools have steep learning curves

**Proof points:**
- Communication style commitment
- Client-friendly documentation

**How to talk about it:**
> "We explain everything in plain English. You'll understand exactly what your AI is doing and why."

### Differentiator 3: Built for SMBs, Not Enterprise

**What it is:** Right-sized solutions for small businesses, not watered-down enterprise products

**Why it matters:** SMBs have different needs, budgets, and priorities than enterprises

**Competitors lack this because:**
- Enterprise agencies are too expensive and complex
- Many automation tools are built for larger companies
- Pricing often doesn't make sense for small businesses

**Proof points:**
- Pricing designed for SMB budgets
- Solutions that match SMB needs

**How to talk about it:**
> "We work with small businesses, not enterprises — so our solutions (and prices) make sense for your stage."
