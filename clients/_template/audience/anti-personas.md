# Anti-Personas

> Who NOT to target — the customers that won't be successful, will churn, or will drain resources.

---

## Why This Matters

Bad-fit customers cost more than they're worth:
- High support burden
- Negative reviews
- Churn that hurts metrics
- Distraction from ideal customers

Knowing who to avoid is as important as knowing who to target.
