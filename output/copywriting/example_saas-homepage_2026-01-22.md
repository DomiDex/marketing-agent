## Problem Section

### Header
Managing remote teams shouldn't feel like air traffic control

### Body
You're juggling Slack threads, missed standups, and that nagging feeling someone's drowning while others coast.

Spreadsheets can't tell you who's actually overloaded. Status meetings eat hours but still miss the real blockers.

Meanwhile, your best people burn out and your projects slip—and you don't see it coming until it's too late.

---

## Solution Section

### Header
See your team's real workload in one view

### Body
TaskFlow connects to your existing tools and shows exactly how work is distributed across your team—not just what's assigned, but what's actually getting done.

**Workload heat maps** reveal who's maxed out before they tell you (or quit).

**AI suggestions** recommend which tasks to reassign and to whom, based on skills and capacity.

**Async updates** replace status meetings with 2-minute daily check-ins your team will actually do.
