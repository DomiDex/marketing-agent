## Hero Section

### Headline (Primary)

### Subheadline

### Headline Alternatives

**Option A (Selected): "Stop doing work your AI should handle."**
- *Rationale:* Direct, challenges the status quo. Creates immediate tension by suggesting they're wasting time on tasks that could be automated. Uses "your AI" to imply ownership and personalization.

**Option B: "Your business runs 24/7. You shouldn't have to."**
- *Rationale:* Speaks to the always-on stress of business ownership. Implies AI can take over when they rest. More emotional appeal.

**Option C: "Finally, AI that works for you — not the other way around."**
- *Rationale:* Addresses the frustration of DIY tools that require constant tinkering. Positions Yaz as the done-for-you alternative. Plays on the irony of "automation" that creates more work.

## Pain / Problem Section

### Section Header

**Sound familiar?**

### Copy

You know AI is changing everything. You've heard the success stories. Maybe you've even tried a few tools.

But here's what actually happened:

- **You signed up for an automation platform** — and spent hours watching tutorials, only to give up when your workflow broke
- **You're still copy-pasting data** between apps because "I'll automate this later" turned into "it's been 6 months"
- **Leads sit in your inbox for hours** (or days) because you can't respond fast enough
- **You hired someone** to handle the busywork — and now you're managing them instead

Meanwhile, your competitors are using AI to respond to leads in minutes, not hours. To follow up automatically. To run operations while they sleep.

You know you need this. You just don't have the time — or the tech skills — to figure it out.

## Solution Intro Section

### Section Header

**What if someone just... handled it?**

### Copy

That's exactly what we do.

**Yaz Automate builds custom AI agents for your business.** Not templates. Not DIY tools. Actual working systems that handle your repetitive tasks — built specifically for how you operate.

And here's the part most tech people skip:

**We explain everything in plain English.**

You'll actually understand what your AI is doing, why it works, and how to use it. No jargon. No "just trust us." Full transparency.

## What We Automate Section

### Section Header

**AI agents that work while you don't**

### Copy

**Appointment Booking**
Let prospects schedule themselves. Handle rescheduling. Send reminders. No back-and-forth emails.

**Data Entry & Reporting**
Pull data from forms, emails, and apps. Update your CRM. Generate reports. Goodbye, spreadsheet Mondays.

## How It Works Section

### Section Header

**Three steps to hands-off automation**

### Copy

**1. Discovery Call**
We talk about your business, your bottlenecks, and where you're losing time. No tech jargon — just a conversation about what's not working.

**2. We Build It**
Our team designs and builds your custom AI agents. You review and give feedback. We handle the technical stuff so you don't have to.

**3. Ongoing Support**
Your agents go live — and we stick around. If something breaks, we fix it. If your needs change, we adjust. You're never left on your own.

## Why Yaz Section

### Section Header

**Not a DIY tool. Not an expensive dev team.**

### Copy

| | DIY Platforms (Zapier, Make) | Dev Teams / Freelancers | Yaz Automate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Setup time** | Weeks of learning | Weeks of back-and-forth | Days |
| **Tech skills needed** | Yes — you build it | No, but you manage them | None |
| **When it breaks** | You debug it | You wait for them | We fix it |
| **Speaks your language** | Documentation | Technical jargon | Plain English |
| **Ongoing support** | Forums and tutorials | Project-based | Included |

**The bottom line:** We handle everything so you don't have to become a tech person. You get the benefits of AI automation without the learning curve.

## FAQ / Objection Handling Section

### Section Header

**Questions you probably have**

### Copy

**"Is AI reliable enough to handle customer interactions?"**

Good question — and the answer is: it depends on how it's built. Our agents are designed with guardrails. They handle routine tasks perfectly, and escalate anything unusual to you. You stay in control. We'll show you exactly how it works before anything goes live.

**"What if something breaks? I don't have tech staff."**

That's why we include ongoing support. If your agent stops working or needs adjustment, you reach out and we handle it. No debugging on your end. No emergency calls to a freelancer who's moved on to another project.

**"How do I know this will actually save me money?"**

We'll walk through the math together on our discovery call. For most clients, the time saved on repetitive tasks pays for the service within the first month or two. And unlike hiring, there are no benefits, sick days, or turnover.

**"I'm not technical at all. Will I understand what you're building?"**

That's the whole point. We explain everything in plain English — what the agent does, why it works, and how to use it. If you ever feel lost, that's on us to fix.

## Annotations: Key Strategic Choices

### Why this headline approach
The selected headline ("Stop doing work your AI should handle") was chosen because:
1. **Creates tension** — suggests they're wasting time, which triggers a response
2. **Implies ownership** — "your AI" makes it feel personal, not generic
3. **Action-oriented** — "Stop" is a command that challenges the status quo

### Why the empathy-first problem section
Rather than leading with features, the problem section uses "sound familiar?" framing to:
1. Build rapport through shared experience
2. Let the reader self-identify as the right customer
3. Increase emotional engagement before presenting the solution

### Trust-building without testimonials
Since Yaz is a startup without social proof yet, the copy builds trust through:
1. **Transparency** — explaining how AI agents work, including limitations
2. **Specificity** — naming exact use cases rather than vague promises
3. **Ongoing support commitment** — addressing the fear of being abandoned
4. **Risk reversal language** — "No sales pitch. No pressure."

### Comparison table rationale
The "Why Yaz" section uses a comparison table because:
1. The audience is likely comparing options (DIY vs hiring)
2. Visual comparison makes differentiation clear at a glance
3. Addresses unspoken concerns (what happens when it breaks?)

### CTA positioning
- **Primary CTA (discovery call)** appears in hero and final section
- **Secondary CTA (see how it works)** gives an alternative for those not ready to commit
- Final section uses explicit risk reversal ("No sales pitch. No pressure")

### Brand voice adherence
Copy maintains the brief's guidelines:
- Casual, conversational tone (contractions, short sentences)
- No jargon (plain English throughout)
- Confident but not pushy (no exclamation points, no "revolutionary")
- Uses approved words (automate, streamline, simple, hands-off, tailored)
