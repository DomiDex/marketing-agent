## Tips for Best Results

### Do This
- **Share your stage** — Pre-launch vs growth-stage needs different tactics
- **Be specific about resources** — "One marketer" vs "marketing team"
- **Mention budget** — $0 vs $10K/month changes everything
- **Share what you've tried** — Avoids repeat suggestions

### Avoid This
- **Trying everything at once** — Pick 2-3 channels to focus on
- **Skipping fundamentals** — Have product-market fit before scaling
- **Ignoring your strengths** — Play to your team's capabilities

### Pro Tips
1. **Focus over variety** — Depth in one channel beats breadth in five
2. **Document what works** — Build your marketing playbook
3. **Measure aggressively** — Know your CAC by channel
4. **Revisit quarterly** — What works changes as you grow
