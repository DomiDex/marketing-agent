## Tips for Best Results

### Do This
- **Start early** — 2-3 weeks prep minimum for major launches
- **Build your audience before you need it** — Launch day is too late
- **Coordinate channels** — Aligned messaging across email, social, PR
- **Define success** — Know what good looks like before launch

### Avoid This
- **Launching on Friday** — Most B2B audiences are checked out
- **One-and-done** — Follow-up is where most value comes
- **Over-promising** — Don't hype what you can't deliver
- **Launching too many things at once** — Focus on one clear message

### Pro Tips
1. **Build in public** — Share progress before launch for anticipation
2. **Have ambassadors ready** — People who will share on day one
3. **Prepare for success** — Can your servers handle traffic?
4. **Document everything** — Build a repeatable launch playbook
