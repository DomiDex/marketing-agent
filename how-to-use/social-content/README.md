## Sample Output Preview

When you run `/social-content`, expect output like this:

```markdown
## LinkedIn Post: AI Prioritization Launch

**Hook (first line that appears in preview):**
Most teams waste their first hour every day deciding what to work on.

**Full Post:**
Most teams waste their first hour every day deciding what to work on.

I see it constantly:
→ Morning standup to "align on priorities"
→ Slack debates about what's urgent
→ Context switching between 5 different tasks
→ End of day: "What did I actually accomplish?"

This is why we built AI Prioritization into TaskFlow.

Every morning, it analyzes your tasks across all projects and tells
you: "Here are the 5 things that matter most today."

Not based on due dates alone. Based on:
• Dependencies
• Team capacity
• Business impact
• Your actual working patterns

The result? Teams using it report 2.4 hours saved per week.

That's 125 hours per year of focused work instead of planning work.

We're rolling it out to all Pro and Team users today.

What's your current system for deciding what to focus on?
Drop it in the comments—curious how others solve this.

**Hashtags:** #projectmanagement #productivity #AI #teamwork

**Visual recommendation:** Screenshot of the AI prioritization
interface showing the morning "Focus List"

**Best posting time:** Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am or 5-7pm

## Twitter Thread Version

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
Most teams waste 5+ hours per week deciding what to work on.

We just fixed that.

Here's how AI is changing project management: 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
The average knowledge worker switches tasks every 3 minutes.

Each switch costs 23 minutes of recovery time.

Do the math: You're bleeding productivity all day.

## Tips for Best Results

### Do This
- **Specify the platform** — Each platform has different best practices
- **Share your voice** — Personal posts need personality context
- **Include the goal** — Engagement vs clicks vs brand awareness
- **Provide key points** — What message must come through?

### Avoid This
- **Cross-posting identical content** — Each platform needs adaptation
- **Ignoring hooks** — First line determines whether people keep reading
- **Too many CTAs** — Social is for engagement, not hard selling
- **Forgetting visuals** — Recommendations help you prepare assets

### Pro Tips
1. **Request hook options** — Test different angles
2. **Ask for platform-specific formatting** — Line breaks, emojis, structure
3. **Include hashtag strategy** — Right hashtags expand reach
4. **Get a content mix** — Thought leadership + product + engagement
