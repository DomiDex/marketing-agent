## Sample Output Preview

```markdown
## Psychology Audit: TaskFlow Marketing

### Principles You're Using Well

**1. Social Proof (Weak Version)**
- You mention "thousands of teams"
- This is good but could be much stronger

**2. Simplification**
- Clean design reduces cognitive load
- Feature sections are scannable

### Critical Principles You're Missing

**1. Loss Aversion**
Current: "Get more done with TaskFlow"
Psychology: People are more motivated to avoid loss than gain benefit

Suggested: "Stop losing 5 hours/week to scattered tasks"
- Frame the problem as ongoing loss
- Make not-buying feel expensive

**2. Anchoring**
Current: Pricing shown without context
Psychology: First number seen influences perception

Suggested:
- "Save $500/month vs hiring a project coordinator"
- Start with Enterprise pricing, then show lower tiers
- Show "per user" price next to "per team" equivalent

**3. Scarcity/Urgency**
Current: No urgency messaging
Psychology: Limited availability increases perceived value

Suggested (ethical approaches):
- "Annual pricing discount ends [date]"
- "Join 200 teams who signed up this month"
- "New AI features launching next week for Pro users"
```

## Tips for Best Results

### Do This
- **Be specific about your challenge** — Generic questions get generic answers
- **Share your current approach** — Helps build on what's working
- **Describe your audience** — Psychology differs by segment
- **Ask for ethical applications** — Manipulation backfires

### Avoid This
- **Manipulation tactics** — Dark patterns hurt trust and retention
- **Applying everything at once** — Pick 2-3 principles to focus on
- **Ignoring context** — B2B ≠ B2C psychology

### Pro Tips
1. **Test psychological assumptions** — What works for others may not work for you
2. **Combine principles** — Social proof + scarcity is stronger than either alone
3. **Match to funnel stage** — Awareness needs different psychology than decision
4. **Document what works** — Build a library of winning approaches
