## Tips for Best Results

### Do This
- **Specify the platform** — Homepage vs LinkedIn vs YouTube = different formats
- **Include the key message** — What's the one thing viewers should remember?
- **Share the tone** — "Professional but fun" vs "serious and technical"
- **Provide timing** — 60 seconds requires very different script than 3 minutes

### Avoid This
- **Too many messages** — One video = one message
- **Script for reading** — Write how people talk
- **Forgetting visual** — Video is visual; describe what viewers see

### Pro Tips
1. **Read it aloud** — Scripts are spoken; test the flow
2. **Time it** — 150 words ≈ 60 seconds of voiceover
3. **Hook fast** — First 5 seconds determine if people watch
4. **Chain with case-study** — Use `/case-study` for testimonial content
