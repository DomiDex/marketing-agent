FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

TASKFLOW RAISES $15M SERIES A TO BRING AI-POWERED PROJECT MANAGEMENT
TO MARKETING TEAMS

Former Asana team builds the first PM tool designed specifically
for campaign workflows

SAN FRANCISCO — March 15, 2026 — TaskFlow, the project management
platform built specifically for marketing teams, today announced it
has raised $15 million in Series A funding led by Acme Ventures,
with participation from Index Ventures and Y Combinator. The round
brings total funding to $18 million.

TaskFlow will use the funds to expand its AI capabilities and grow
its team from 20 to 50 employees as it meets growing demand from
marketing teams frustrated with generic project management tools.

"Every marketing team I talk to is drowning in campaigns spread across
Slack, spreadsheets, and PM tools that weren't built for them," said
Jane Smith, CEO and co-founder of TaskFlow. "We're building the first
project management platform that actually understands how marketing
teams work."

Since launching in 2024, TaskFlow has grown to over 2,000 paying
customers with 300% year-over-year revenue growth. The platform is
used by marketing teams at companies including Stripe and Notion.

"TaskFlow has transformed how our marketing team operates," said
Alex Chen, Head of Marketing at Stripe. "We've cut campaign launch
time by 40% since switching from our old tools."

"The marketing team's workflow is fundamentally different from
engineering or sales, yet they've been stuck with one-size-fits-all
tools," said Sarah Johnson, Partner at Acme Ventures. "TaskFlow's
team has the experience and vision to own this category."

TaskFlow's AI-powered features include campaign templates, automated
task prioritization, and predictive timeline management—all designed
specifically for marketing workflows.

## Tips for Best Results

### Do This
- **Lead with the news** — First sentence should have the headline
- **Include specific numbers** — $15M, 300% growth, 2,000 customers
- **Prepare good quotes** — Insight, not fluff
- **Know your audience** — Tech press vs industry vs local

### Avoid This
- **Marketing speak** — "Revolutionary" and "game-changing" turn off journalists
- **Burying the lead** — Don't make readers hunt for the news
- **Too long** — 400-600 words ideal

### Pro Tips
1. **Offer exclusives** — Top-tier publications value being first
2. **Personalize pitches** — Reference their recent work
3. **Timing matters** — Tuesday-Thursday mornings are best
4. **Chain with launch-strategy** — Use `/launch-strategy` for full launch planning
