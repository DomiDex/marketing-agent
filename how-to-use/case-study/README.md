## Tips for Best Results

### Do This
- **Provide specific numbers** — "40% faster" beats "much faster"
- **Include direct quotes** — Customer voice adds authenticity
- **Specify the format** — One-pager vs long-form vs video script
- **Share the target audience** — Enterprise vs SMB changes the angle

### Avoid This
- **Generic outcomes** — "Improved efficiency" doesn't persuade
- **Missing customer approval** — Note if quotes need sign-off
- **Feature focus** — Results matter more than features used

### Pro Tips
1. **Lead with the biggest number** — The headline metric should stop scrollers
2. **Include timeline** — "In 90 days" manages expectations
3. **Address objections** — If buyers worry about implementation, cover it
4. **Create variations** — Same story, different formats for different channels
