- Continuous monitoring for SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA
- Integrates with 100+ tools
- Real-time audit readiness dashboard

Competitors:
- Vanta (well-funded, SMB-focused)
- Drata (similar positioning)

### Example 3: Competitive Repositioning (Advanced)

```
/positioning

Help us reposition against a new competitor.

Current situation:
- We're DataViz, a BI tool for analysts
- We've positioned as "powerful and flexible"
- New competitor ThoughtSpot launched with "AI-powered insights"
- They're winning deals by claiming we're "too complex"

Our reality:
- We have AI features too (just not highlighted)
- We ARE more powerful (their AI is basic)
- Enterprise customers love our depth
- SMB finds us overwhelming

Need:
1. New positioning that neutralizes their AI claim
2. Turns our complexity into a strength
3. Protects enterprise while improving SMB appeal
```

**What you'll get:** Repositioning strategy with new messaging framework that addresses competitive threat while leveraging existing strengths.

### Example 4: Category Creation (Advanced)

```
/positioning

Help us define a new category.

Problem:
- We're a "project management tool" but that's crowded
- What we really do is different: we're focused on project financials
- Competitors focus on tasks/timelines; we focus on budgets/profitability
- Current category doesn't capture our value

Product reality:
- Track project budgets in real-time
- Forecast profitability before projects finish
- Compare estimated vs actual costs
- Resource cost optimization

Target: Professional services firms (agencies, consultancies)
Current category: "Project Management" (wrong)
Competitors in that category: Asana, Monday (not really competitors)

Need: A new category we can own
```

**What you'll get:** Category design strategy with category name options, definition, positioning as category leader, and go-to-market approach.

---

```
/positioning

Create positioning variations for different segments.

Product: APIHub - API marketplace and management

Segments:
1. Developers - Want easy API discovery and testing
2. Product Managers - Want to monetize their APIs
3. Enterprise Architects - Want governance and security

Core positioning should work for all, but need specific
angles for each segment.

Competitors:
- RapidAPI (developer-focused)
- Mulesoft (enterprise-focused)
- Postman (testing-focused)
```

**What you'll get:** Core positioning with segment-specific variations, each with tailored messaging and proof points.

---

### Example 6: Value Proposition Testing (Validation)

```
/positioning

Product: SalesBot - AI sales assistant that writes follow-up emails

Target: SDRs and AEs at B2B SaaS companies

What we know:
- Saves 2 hours/day on email writing
- Increases response rates 40%
- Learns from your best performers
- Integrates with Outreach, Salesloft

What we don't know:
- Do they care more about time saved or response rates?
- Is "AI" a positive or negative framing?
- Should we lead with productivity or effectiveness?

Need: 3-4 value proposition options to A/B test
```

**What you'll get:** Multiple value proposition variations with hypotheses, testing recommendations, and implementation guidance.

## Tips for Best Results

### Do This
- **Include customer language** — Use their words, not yours
- **Share competitive context** — Helps find whitespace
- **Be honest about weaknesses** — Positioning should be defensible
- **Define success criteria** — What does good positioning look like for you?

### Avoid This
- **Positioning by committee** — Too many cooks create mush

- **Copying competitors** — Find your own angle

### Pro Tips
1. **Validate with customers** — Test positioning before committing
2. **Start with differentiation** — What can only you claim?
3. **Simple beats clever** — Clear positioning wins
4. **Chain with copywriting** — Use `/copywriting` to execute positioning
