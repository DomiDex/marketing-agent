## Content Strategy Frameworks

### Framework 1: Topic Clusters (SEO-Focused)

Build authority through interconnected content:

**Pillar Page**: Comprehensive guide on core topic (2,000-4,000 words)
**Cluster Content**: Related subtopics linking back to pillar (800-1,500 words each)
**Internal Linking**: Every cluster links to pillar, pillar links to clusters

**Example Structure:**
```
Pillar: "The Complete Guide to Project Management for Startups"
├── Cluster: "How to Run Effective Sprint Planning"
├── Cluster: "Project Management Tools Compared"
├── Cluster: "Building a Project Management Culture"
├── Cluster: "Common Project Management Mistakes"
└── Cluster: "Project Management for Remote Teams"
```

### Framework 2: Funnel-Aligned Content

Match content to buyer journey:

**Top of Funnel (Awareness)**
- Problem-focused content
- Industry trends and insights
- "What is X?" educational content
- Broad keyword targeting

**Middle of Funnel (Consideration)**

- Comparison and evaluation guides
- Case studies and use cases
- How-to content with product mentions

**Bottom of Funnel (Decision)**
- Product-focused content
- Implementation guides
- ROI calculators and worksheets
- Customer success stories

### Framework 3: Content Pillars

Organize around 3-5 core themes:

**Define Pillars Based On:**
- Core product capabilities
- Customer pain points
- Industry expertise areas
- Competitive differentiation

**Example for a CRM company:**
1. Sales Productivity
2. Customer Relationships
3. Revenue Operations
4. Team Collaboration
5. Sales Leadership

### Framework 4: AIDA for Individual Posts

Structure each post for conversion:

**Attention**: Hook with a compelling opener

## Writing Principles

### Hook Immediately
The first 100 words determine if readers stay.

**Weak Opening:**
"In today's business world, project management is important..."

**Strong Opening:**
"Your last three projects went over budget. Two missed their deadlines. Sound familiar? Here's how to fix it."

### Write for Scanners
Most readers skim. Structure for it:

- Use descriptive H2s and H3s
- Bold key takeaways
- Use bullet points liberally
- Keep paragraphs to 3-4 lines max
- Add visual breaks every 300-400 words

### Be Specific
Vague content gets ignored.

**Weak**: "Save time with automation"
**Strong**: "Automate your weekly reports and save 3 hours every Friday"

### Add Unique Value
Don't just rewrite what's already ranking.

- Original data or research
- Expert quotes or interviews
- Unique frameworks or templates
- Personal experience or case studies
- Contrarian but defensible takes

### Optimize for Intent
Match content to what the searcher actually wants.

- "What is X" → Definition + overview
- "How to X" → Step-by-step instructions
- "Best X" → Curated list with recommendations
- "X vs Y" → Objective comparison with verdict
