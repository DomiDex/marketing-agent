# Retention Strategy

## Before Creating Retention Strategies

Gather essential context:

### 1. Current State
- What's the current churn rate?
- When do customers typically churn?
- What are the main churn reasons?
- What retention efforts exist?

### 2. Customer Data
- What customer segments exist?
- Which segments churn most/least?
- What usage patterns correlate with retention?
- How do you track customer health?

### 3. Product Context
- What's the core value proposition?
- What features drive stickiness?
- Are there expansion opportunities (upsell/cross-sell)?
- What's the pricing model?

### 4. Resources
- Is there a customer success team?
- What communication channels are available?
- What data/analytics exist?
- What's the budget for retention efforts?
