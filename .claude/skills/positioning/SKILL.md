# Positioning

## Before Creating Positioning

Gather essential context:

### 1. Product Understanding
- What does the product do?
- What problem does it solve?
- How is it different from alternatives?
- What's the unfair advantage?

### 2. Market Understanding
- What category does it compete in?
- Who are the main competitors?
- What do competitors claim?
- What's the market dynamic? (growing, mature, disrupted)

### 3. Customer Understanding
- Who are the ideal customers?
- What do they struggle with?
- What do they value most?
- What language do they use?

### 4. Business Context
- What are the growth goals?
- What segments matter most?
- Any positioning constraints?
- What positioning has been tried?

## Positioning Frameworks

### Framework 1: Classic Positioning Statement

The foundational positioning format:

```
For [target customer]
who [has this need/problem],
[Product name] is a [category]
that [key benefit/point of differentiation].
Unlike [primary competitor],
we [unique differentiator].
```

**Example:**
```
For B2B marketing teams
who struggle to measure content ROI,
ContentMetrics is a marketing analytics platform
that connects content to revenue.
Unlike Google Analytics,
we show exactly which blog posts generate pipeline.
```

### Framework 2: Value Proposition Canvas

Map customer needs to product capabilities:

**Customer Profile (Right Side):**
- Customer Jobs: What they're trying to accomplish
- Pains: Frustrations, obstacles, risks
- Gains: Desired outcomes, benefits, aspirations

**Value Map (Left Side):**
- Products & Services: What you offer
- Pain Relievers: How you address frustrations
- Gain Creators: How you deliver benefits

**Fit:** Where value map addresses customer profile

### Framework 3: Messaging Hierarchy

Structured framework for consistent communication:

```
LEVEL 1: Positioning Statement
└── LEVEL 2: Value Pillars (3-4)
    ├── Pillar 1: [Key benefit area]
    │   └── Supporting messages
    │   └── Proof points
    ├── Pillar 2: [Key benefit area]
    │   └── Supporting messages
    │   └── Proof points
    └── Pillar 3: [Key benefit area]
        └── Supporting messages
        └── Proof points
```

### Framework 4: Category Design

Create or redefine your category:

**When to Use:**
- Existing category doesn't fit
- You're fundamentally different
- Market needs education
- Opportunity to own a space

**Category Design Steps:**
1. Identify the problem with current category
2. Name the new category
3. Define what the category is (and isn't)
4. Establish category criteria
5. Position yourself as category leader

**Category Naming Tips:**
- Descriptive but distinctive
- Easy to understand
- Hard to argue against
- Ownable by you

### Framework 5: Strategic Narrative

Story-based positioning for complex products:

**Structure:**
1. **The Shift:** What's changing in the world
2. **The Stakes:** Why it matters (winners and losers)
3. **The Old Way:** How people handled it before
4. **The New Way:** The better approach
5. **Your Solution:** How you enable the new way
6. **The Proof:** Evidence it works

## Value Proposition Development

### What Makes a Strong Value Proposition

**Clear:** Understood in 5 seconds
**Specific:** Not vague or generic
**Differentiated:** Distinct from competitors
**Valuable:** Addresses real customer need
**Believable:** Credible with proof

### Value Proposition Formula

**[End result customer wants]** + **[Specific period of time]** + **[Address objections]**

**Examples:**
- "Get 10x more qualified leads from your blog in 30 days — no technical skills required"
- "Cut customer support time in half within 2 weeks with AI that actually understands context"

### Value Proposition Testing

**5-Second Test:** Can someone understand what you do in 5 seconds?
**So What Test:** Does it pass "so what?" scrutiny?
**Prove It Test:** Can you back it up with evidence?
**Only We Test:** Could a competitor say the same thing?

## Messaging Framework Components

### 1. Brand Promise
One sentence that captures what you deliver.
"We help [audience] achieve [outcome] by [how]."

### 2. Tagline
Memorable phrase that captures essence.
- Keep under 8 words
- Emotional or aspirational
- Easy to remember

### 3. Elevator Pitch
30-second explanation.
- Who you help
- What problem you solve
- How you're different
- What's the result

### 4. Value Pillars
3-4 main benefit areas that support your positioning.
Each pillar should be:
- Distinct from others
- Supported by proof
- Meaningful to customers

### 5. Proof Points
Evidence that supports each claim:
- Customer metrics
- Case studies
- Third-party validation
- Product capabilities

### 6. Competitive Differentiators
What you do that others don't/can't:
- Technical advantages
- Approach differences
- Unique capabilities
- Business model differences

## Positioning by Segment

Different segments may need different positioning angles:

### Segment Positioning Template

```markdown
## Segment: [Name]

### Primary Need
[What they care most about]

### Key Pain Points
1. [Pain 1]
2. [Pain 2]
3. [Pain 3]

### How We're Positioned
For this segment, emphasize:
- [Primary message]
- [Secondary message]

### Proof Points
- [Relevant case study]
- [Relevant metric]

### Language to Use
- [Terms they use]
- [Concepts they value]

### Language to Avoid
- [What doesn't resonate]
```

## Competitive Positioning

### Positioning Map

Plot competitors on key dimensions:

```
                    High Price
                        │
        Enterprise      │      Premium
        Complex         │      Simple
                        │
    ────────────────────┼────────────────────
                        │
        Budget          │      Mid-Market
        Complex         │      Simple
                        │
                    Low Price
```

### Competitive Positioning Strategies

**Head-to-Head:** Directly challenge the leader
- Requires resources and differentiation
- High risk, high reward

**Flanking:** Attack where competitors are weak
- Find underserved segment or need
- Build strength in that area

**Niche:** Own a specific segment entirely
- Go deep, not broad
- Become the obvious choice for [specific need]

**Blue Ocean:** Create new category/market
- Redefine the competition
- Requires market education

## Positioning Pitfalls

### 1. Too Broad
"We help businesses grow" — everyone says this.
**Fix:** Get specific about who and how.

### 2. Feature-Focused
"We have AI-powered analytics" — features don't differentiate.
**Fix:** Lead with outcomes, support with features.

### 3. Undifferentiated
"We're the best project management tool" — no unique claim.
**Fix:** Find what you do that competitors can't/don't.

### 4. Unbelievable
"10x your revenue guaranteed" — too good to be true.
**Fix:** Make credible claims you can prove.

### 5. Complicated
"We leverage synergistic paradigms to optimize..." — jargon-filled.
**Fix:** Simple language, clear benefit.

### 6. Me-Too
"Like [Competitor] but better" — derivative positioning.
**Fix:** Find your own angle, don't just compare.
