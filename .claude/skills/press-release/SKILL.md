## Press Release Structure

### Standard Press Release Format

```
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
(or EMBARGOED UNTIL [Date, Time, Timezone])

HEADLINE
[Clear, newsworthy headline under 80 characters]

SUBHEADLINE (Optional)
[Supporting context or key stat]

CITY, STATE — DATE — [Opening paragraph with the news hook.
Who, what, when, where, why. Most important info first.]

[Second paragraph expanding on the news. Add context,
significance, or key details.]

"[Quote from company executive about significance and vision.]"
— Name, Title, Company

[Third paragraph with supporting details. Features,
benefits, or additional context.]

[Fourth paragraph with proof points. Customer validation,
metrics, or third-party support.]

"[Optional: Customer or partner quote about the news.]"
— Name, Title, Company

[Availability/next steps paragraph. Where to learn more,
when available, how to access.]

### About [Company Name]

[Boilerplate: 2-3 sentence company description. What you do,
who you serve, key differentiator. Include website.]

### Media Contact

[Name]
[Email]
[Phone]

###
```

### Inverted Pyramid Rule

Structure information by importance:
1. **Most critical** — The news itself (paragraph 1)
2. **Important details** — Context and significance (paragraph 2-3)
3. **Supporting info** — Quotes and proof points (paragraph 4-5)
4. **Background** — Company boilerplate (end)

Journalists read from top down. They cut from bottom up.

---

## Writing Principles

### Lead with the News
First paragraph must answer: What happened and why does it matter?

**Weak:**
"TaskFlow, a leading project management solution, today announced..."

**Strong:**
"TaskFlow raised $20M to expand its AI-powered project management platform,
which has grown 300% in the past year."

### Be Specific
Journalists want facts, not marketing speak.

**Weak:**
"Significant funding from leading investors"

**Strong:**
"$20 million Series A led by Acme Ventures with participation from
Index and existing investor Y Combinator"

### Quotes Should Add Value
Quotes should provide insight, not repeat what's in the text.

**Weak Quote:**
"We're excited to announce this funding round."

**Strong Quote:**
"Every marketing team drowns in tools that weren't built for campaigns.
With this funding, we'll make campaign chaos a thing of the past."

### Prove It
Include evidence that supports the story.

- Customer metrics
- Growth numbers
- Industry recognition
- Named customers (with permission)

### Keep It Short
Ideal length: 400-600 words
Journalists skim. Respect their time.
