# Case Study

## Before Writing

Gather essential context:

### 1. Customer Profile
- Company name, industry, size
- Their role in the buying decision
- How long they've been a customer
- What plan/tier they use

### 2. The Challenge
- What problem were they trying to solve?
- What was the impact of that problem? (time, money, frustration)
- What had they tried before?
- Why did those solutions fail?

### 3. The Solution
- Why did they choose your product?
- How do they use it? (specific workflows)
- What features are most valuable to them?
- How was the implementation/onboarding?

### 4. The Results
- Quantifiable outcomes (%, $, time saved)
- Qualitative outcomes (peace of mind, confidence)
- Before/after comparison
- Timeline to see results

### 5. Available Assets
- Direct quotes from the customer
- Screenshots or visuals
- Specific data points
- Permission level (name, logo, photo?)

## Case Study Frameworks

### Framework 1: Challenge-Solution-Results (CSR)

The classic B2B case study structure:

**1. The Challenge (25%)**
- Set the scene with relatable pain
- Make the reader think "that's us"
- Include specific, tangible problems
- Show the cost of inaction

**2. The Solution (25%)**
- Explain why they chose you
- Describe implementation briefly
- Highlight key features used
- Focus on the "how" of solving the problem

**3. The Results (50%)**
- Lead with the biggest number
- Include 2-3 key metrics
- Add qualitative benefits
- Quote the customer on the outcome

### Framework 2: Hero's Journey

Narrative structure for emotional resonance:

**1. The Ordinary World** - Customer's situation before
**2. The Call to Adventure** - The problem that demanded change
**3. Meeting the Mentor** - Discovering your solution
**4. Crossing the Threshold** - Deciding to implement
**5. Tests and Allies** - Implementation challenges
**6. The Transformation** - Results achieved
**7. Return with the Elixir** - New capabilities and confidence

### Framework 3: Problem-Agitation-Solution-Proof (PASP)

For maximum persuasion:

**Problem**: State the issue clearly
**Agitation**: Emphasize the pain and consequences
**Solution**: Introduce how you solved it
**Proof**: Show undeniable evidence of success

## Writing Principles

### Lead with Results
Don't bury the outcome. Start with the headline metric.

**Weak**: "Acme Corp implemented TaskFlow in January 2024..."
**Strong**: "Acme Corp reduced project delays by 47% in 90 days with TaskFlow"

### Be Specific
Vague claims destroy credibility. Numbers tell the story.

**Weak**: "Significantly improved efficiency"
**Strong**: "Cut weekly status meeting time from 3 hours to 45 minutes"

### Use Customer Voice
Direct quotes are more credible than paraphrase.

**Weak**: The team found the tool easy to use.
**Strong**: "We were up and running in two days. No training needed." — Sarah Chen, VP Operations

### Show, Don't Just Tell
Include context that makes results believable.

**Weak**: "Saved 10 hours per week"
**Strong**: "Before TaskFlow, their 8-person team spent 10+ hours weekly hunting for project updates across Slack, email, and spreadsheets. Now they check one dashboard."

### Address Skepticism
Proactively handle objections.

**Include**:
- Timeline to results (manages expectations)
- Implementation effort (shows feasibility)
- Team size/complexity (demonstrates relevance)

## Extracting Great Quotes

### Questions That Yield Quotable Answers

**On the problem**:
- "What was the most frustrating part of your old process?"
- "How did this problem affect your team day-to-day?"
- "What would have happened if you hadn't solved this?"

**On the solution**:
- "What made you choose us over alternatives?"
- "What's your favorite feature and why?"
- "How would you describe us to a colleague?"

**On the results**:
- "What's the biggest change since implementing?"
- "What can you do now that you couldn't before?"
- "How has this affected your team's morale/workload?"

**On recommendation**:
- "Who would you recommend this to?"
- "What would you tell someone considering us?"
- "What surprised you most about working with us?"

### Quote Polishing Rules

1. **Keep the essence, clean the grammar**
   - Remove filler words (um, like, you know)
   - Fix obvious grammatical errors
   - Preserve their voice and word choices

2. **Get approval on edits**
   - Always send back for sign-off
   - Offer alternatives if they want changes
   - Never fabricate quotes

3. **Context is key**
   - Include title and company
   - Add context when needed (size, industry)
   - Date quotes if time-sensitive

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Too Much About You
Focus on the customer's story, not your product features. The customer is the hero, your product is the tool.

### 2. Generic Claims
"Improved efficiency" means nothing. "Cut invoice processing from 3 days to 4 hours" is memorable.

### 3. Buried Results
Don't make readers hunt for the payoff. Lead with outcomes.

### 4. Missing Customer Voice
Without direct quotes, it's just marketing copy. Quotes add credibility and authenticity.

### 5. One-Size-Fits-All
Different prospects need different case studies. Organize by:
- Industry vertical
- Company size
- Use case/problem
- Product/feature

### 6. No Clear Next Step
Every case study should end with a CTA that makes sense for the reader's journey.

## Output Structure

When creating a case study, output should include:

### Primary Deliverable
