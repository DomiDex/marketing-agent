### Framework 4: Content Pillar Planning

**Use when**: Defining strategic content themes

**Structure**:

```markdown
# Content Pillars: [Client]

## Overview

Content pillars are the 3-5 core themes that guide all content. Every piece of content should map to a pillar.

---

## Pillar 1: [Name]

**Theme**: [What this pillar is about]

**Why it matters**: [Business reason for this pillar]

**Audience interest**: [Why audience cares]

**Content types**:
- Blog posts about [topics]
- Social content on [angles]
- Email sequences covering [themes]

**Example topics**:
- [Topic 1]
- [Topic 2]
- [Topic 3]

**Mix**: [X]% of content

---

## Pillar 2: [Name]

[Same structure]

---

## Pillar 3: [Name]

[Same structure]

---

## Pillar Mix

| Pillar | % of Content | Primary Channels |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| [Pillar 1] | [X]% | [Channels] |
| [Pillar 2] | [X]% | [Channels] |
| [Pillar 3] | [X]% | [Channels] |

**Visual**:
```
[Pillar 1] ████████████████████ 40%
[Pillar 2] ██████████████ 30%
[Pillar 3] ██████████████ 30%
```

---

## Pillar Rotation

How pillars rotate through the content calendar:

| Week | Primary Pillar | Secondary |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| Week 1 | [Pillar 1] | [Pillar 2] |
| Week 2 | [Pillar 2] | [Pillar 3] |
| Week 3 | [Pillar 3] | [Pillar 1] |
| Week 4 | [Pillar 1] | [Flexible] |

---

## Reviewing Pillars

Review pillars quarterly:
- Are they still relevant?
- Does audience engage?
- Do they align with business goals?
- Should any be retired/added?
```

---

## Channel Coordination

### Cross-Channel Timing

**Best practices for coordination**:

| Channel | Lead Time | Frequency | Best Days |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Blog | 1 week | 1-4x/month | Tue-Thu |
| Email | 3-5 days | 1-4x/month | Tue-Thu |
| LinkedIn | 1-3 days | 3-5x/week | Tue-Thu |
| Twitter | Same day | 1-5x/day | Any |

### Amplification Pattern

For a single piece of anchor content:

```
Day 0:  Blog post publishes
Day 1:  LinkedIn post announcing blog
Day 1:  Twitter thread with key points
Day 2:  Email newsletter featuring post
Day 3:  LinkedIn follow-up discussion
Day 5:  Repurpose as carousel/infographic
Day 7:  Second email to non-openers
```

### CTA Coordination

Avoid competing CTAs:
- One primary CTA per campaign
- Channel CTAs should align
- Different channels can have different ask levels

| Channel | CTA Level | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Social | Low friction | "Read more", "Comment" |
| Blog | Medium | "Sign up for newsletter" |
| Email | Higher | "Start free trial" |
| Landing | Highest | "Buy now", "Book demo" |

---

## Timing Optimization

### By Platform

**Email**:
- Best days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- Best times: 10am, 2pm (recipient time zone)
- Avoid: Monday morning, Friday afternoon

**LinkedIn**:
- Best days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- Best times: 7-8am, 12pm, 5-6pm
- Avoid: Weekends (lower reach)

**Twitter/X**:
- Best days: Variable by audience
- Best times: 9am, 12pm, 5pm
- Can post multiple times per day

**Blog**:
- Best publish days: Tuesday-Thursday
- Best times: Morning (for social amplification)
- Avoid: Friday (less sharing)

### By Campaign Type

| Campaign Type | Lead Time | Duration |
|---------------|-----------|----------|
| Product launch | 2-4 weeks | 1-2 weeks active |
| Promotion | 1-2 weeks | 3-7 days active |
| Evergreen | Ongoing | Continuous |
| Seasonal | 4-6 weeks | Variable |
