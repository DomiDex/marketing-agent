# Video Script

## Before Writing

Gather essential context:

### 1. Video Purpose
- What action should viewers take?
- What's the key message?
- Where in the funnel does this sit?
- What problem does the video solve?

### 2. Audience
- Who is the target viewer?
- What do they already know?
- What do they care about?
- Where will they watch this?

### 3. Platform/Format
- Where will this be published? (website, social, YouTube)
- What's the ideal length?
- What style fits? (animated, live action, screen recording)
- Will there be voiceover, on-screen talent, or both?

### 4. Brand Guidelines
- What's the tone? (professional, casual, energetic)
- Are there brand voice guidelines?
- Any specific language to use or avoid?
- Music/visual style preferences?

## Writing Principles

### Hook Immediately
First 3-5 seconds determine if people watch.

**Weak Hook:**
"Hi, I'm John from Acme Corp. Today I want to talk about..."

**Strong Hook:**
"You're wasting 10 hours a week on reports nobody reads."

### Write for Speaking
Scripts are spoken, not read.

- Use contractions (we're, you'll, it's)
- Short sentences (under 15 words ideal)
- Simple words (use, not utilize)
- Conversational tone (like explaining to a friend)

### Show, Don't Tell
Video is visual. Use it.

**Weak:**
"Our dashboard is easy to use."

**Strong:**
[VISUAL: User completing task in 3 clicks]
"Three clicks. Done."

### One Idea at a Time
Don't overwhelm. Each scene = one concept.

### Time Your Script
Rule of thumb: 150 words = 60 seconds
Read aloud to test pacing.
