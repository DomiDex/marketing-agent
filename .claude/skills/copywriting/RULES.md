## Skill-Specific Standards

### Headline Standards
- [ ] Primary headline is under 10 words
- [ ] Headline uses benefit-focused language, not feature descriptions
- [ ] Headline would make a distracted visitor stop and read
- [ ] At least 2-3 headline alternatives provided
- [ ] Each alternative has a clear rationale

### Value Proposition
- [ ] Core value proposition is stated within first 50 words
- [ ] Transformation/outcome is specific (numbers, timeframes, concrete details)
- [ ] Addresses a real pain point the audience recognizes
- [ ] Uses customer language, not internal company jargon

### Page Structure
- [ ] Above-the-fold content includes: headline, subheadline, CTA, and value context
- [ ] Sections build a logical argument (problem → solution → proof → action)
- [ ] Section variety used (not just feature list - includes social proof, use cases, comparisons, etc.)
- [ ] Page has one primary CTA, with secondary CTAs clearly subordinate
- [ ] CTA buttons use action + outcome format (not generic "Submit" or "Click here")

### Social Proof
- [ ] Testimonials are specific and include attribution (name, role, company)
- [ ] Case study snippets include measurable results
- [ ] Customer logos are recognizable or numerous (quantity builds credibility)
- [ ] Social proof placed near decision points (before/after CTAs)

### Copy Quality
- [ ] Every sentence serves a purpose (no filler)
- [ ] Benefits are quantified where possible ("50% faster" vs "much faster")
- [ ] Active voice used throughout
- [ ] Reading level appropriate for audience (typically 6th-8th grade for broad audiences)
- [ ] Zero exclamation points in body copy

### Formatting
- [ ] Paragraphs are 1-3 sentences max
- [ ] Bullet lists have 3-7 items (not more)
- [ ] Key benefits are **bolded** for scanners
- [ ] Headers break content every 150-300 words

## Anti-Patterns

1. **Feature dumping**: Listing features without connecting to benefits
   → Instead: For each feature, add "which means you can [benefit]"

2. **Jargon overload**: Using terms like "leverage," "synergy," "best-in-class"
   → Instead: Use plain language. "Use" not "leverage"

3. **Vague claims**: "The best solution" or "World-class platform"
   → Instead: Specific proof. "Used by 5,000+ teams" or "Saves 4 hours/week"

4. **Passive voice**: "Reports are generated automatically"
   → Instead: Active voice. "Generate reports automatically"

5. **Buried value**: The real benefit appears in paragraph 3
   → Instead: Lead with the transformation. First sentence should hook.

6. **CTA hiding**: Button is below the fold or visually weak
   → Instead: CTA visible on first screen with strong visual contrast

7. **Wall of text**: No visual breaks, long paragraphs
   → Instead: Short paragraphs, bullets, headers, whitespace

8. **Clever over clear**: Puns or wordplay that obscure meaning
   → Instead: Clear beats clever. Always.
