## SOP Writing Guidelines

### Best Practices

1. **Use action verbs** — Start each step with a verb (Create, Review, Submit, Verify)
2. **One action per step** — Break complex actions into multiple steps
3. **Be specific** — Include exact button names, menu paths, field values
4. **Include screenshots** — Visual aids for complex UI interactions
5. **Test the SOP** — Have someone unfamiliar follow it to validate clarity

### Action Verbs for SOPs

| Category | Verbs |
|----------|-------|
| **Create** | Create, Generate, Build, Prepare, Draft |
| **Review** | Review, Check, Verify, Validate, Confirm |
| **Update** | Update, Edit, Modify, Revise, Correct |
| **Send** | Send, Submit, Share, Distribute, Forward |
| **Access** | Log in, Navigate, Open, Access, Launch |
| **Record** | Document, Record, Log, Note, Track |

### Time Estimates Guide

| Task Type | Typical Duration |
|-----------|------------------|
| Simple data entry | 1-5 minutes |
| System navigation | 2-10 minutes |
| Review/approval | 5-30 minutes |
| Complex analysis | 30-60 minutes |
| Full process | Varies — sum steps |
