## Business Case Tips

1. **Lead with the bottom line** — Executives read the summary first
2. **Quantify everything possible** — Soft benefits are harder to approve
3. **Be conservative** — Overestimating ROI damages credibility
4. **Show your math** — Include calculation methodology
5. **Address the "do nothing" option** — Compare against status quo
6. **Include risk-adjusted numbers** — Shows realistic thinking
