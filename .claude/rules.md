# Marketing Content Rules

Quality standards for all generated marketing content.

## Writing Rules

### Headlines
- Lead with benefit, not feature
- Use specific numbers when possible
- Keep under 10 words for primary headlines
- Test: Would this make someone stop scrolling?

### Body Copy
- One idea per paragraph
- Sentences under 20 words average
- Use "you" more than "we"
- Cut filler words: very, really, just, actually

### CTAs
- Start with action verb
- Create urgency without being pushy
- Be specific: "Start free trial" > "Get started"
- One primary CTA per section

## Formatting Standards

### Structure
- H1: One per page (main headline)
- H2: Major sections
- H3: Subsections
- Bullet points: 3-7 items max

### Emphasis
- **Bold** for key benefits
- *Italics* sparingly for emphasis
- Never ALL CAPS except acronyms

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any content:

- [ ] Headline passes the "so what?" test
- [ ] Benefits are specific and quantified
- [ ] No grammatical errors
- [ ] CTA is clear and compelling
- [ ] Reads naturally when spoken aloud
- [ ] Matches brand voice guidelines
- [ ] Mobile-friendly formatting

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Feature dumping** - List benefits, not feature lists
2. **Passive voice** - "You'll save time" not "Time will be saved"
3. **Weak verbs** - "Boost" not "help with"
4. **Vague claims** - "50% faster" not "blazing fast"
5. **Wall of text** - Break it up with whitespace
